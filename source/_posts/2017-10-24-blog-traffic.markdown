I was not active in this blog over past one month due to multiple reasons - both personal and professional. Following are some highlights over past one month.

### ISTQB Test Automation Engineer ###

As mentioned in previous [post]({{site.root}}blog/2017/08/29/anztb-sigist-conference/), I had a chance to attend ANZTB SIGiST conference in August 2017. There were some good talks about various certifications offered by ISTQB/ANZTB.  ISTQB [Test Automation Engineer](http://www.anztb.org/advancedlevel.php) was one among them. I decided to give that a try . Spend some time over past one month to prepare based on the syllabus and I gave it a shot. Fortunately, I passed the exam with good marks

### Traffic to 	blog
I had an interesting observation when I looked into google analytics for the blog. The traffic to this blog has grown over ten times compared to previous months. I analyzed the data and found that my blog and [github repo](https://github.com/abygeorgea/MountebankExamples) for mountebank examples are mentioned in [mountebank website](http://www.mbtest.org/docs/examples). This resulted in having more traffic to the blog. I hope others are also benefitted from my experience with mountebank and the tutorial which I have in this blog. Hopefully, this will give me the motivation to write more.
