	*  50% - Test activities - varies differently depending on test cycle. test plan, test strategy, prioritisation of defects & test cases, identifying the planned test cases for the day, defect retest, test execution 
	*  20% - review of work done by team mates
	*  10% - coordination between different teams, monitoring the progress
	*  
2. Normal test process in your current company
	* Agile methodology 
	* Ownership of stories on complete team . what that means is , while user stories are in progress, we don't raise bugs. Instead we move it back to dev and get if fixed. Defects are raised only if it needs to be carried over and will take time to fix . But most of the expected acceptance criteria is done
	* previous projects had onshore offshore models
	* all review , metrics etc are done within sprint
	* 
3. Key achievements
	* leading lights nomination
	* Digital Kudos nomination
	* mentioned in segment scrum
	* stream lined reporting process
	* created new report format for status update
	* succesfuly managed end to end testing of multi million testing engagement
	* Improved automation ratio of the projects
	* managed to remove downstream dependency while testing
	*
4. How to do test estimation
	* Discuss with test team and dev team/architect to identify the solution
	* Identify scope of testing for which test estimation is needed. There are chances that other test phases like System testing or end to end testing , performance testing etc will be done by different team.
	* Discuss with test team to come up 
5. What to do when there is not enough time for testing
6. What to do when a critical bug is found one day prior to release
